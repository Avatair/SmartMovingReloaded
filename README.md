# Smart Moving Reloaded

The [original](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1274224-smart-moving) Smart Moving was created by Divisor. Because it has not been updated since Minecraft 1.8.9, I have decided to make my own mod with a similar goal of providing additional movement possibilities.

**Note:** At the moment, this mod is in alpha with many potential *bugs* and *unimplemented features*.

## Benefits

* Uses Mixins to modify base Minecraft classes instead of completely rewriting them
* Updated to Minecraft 1.12.2
* Fixes long-standing vanilla bug [MC-90598](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-90598)

## Developing

* Make sure to run `gradlew installLombok` to install [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) integration into your IDE
